# SuperSmartClockðŸ•’

Super Smart Clock is a perfect useful decoration, the cost of the entire clock is $ 20 which makes it really profitable, it uses a max7219 led matrix. It communicates with the user via the web interface and the mqtt protocol.

# ðŸ’¡ Features 
- Support for mqtt protocol, possibility of integration with HASS
- Displaying notifications from HASS (mqtt)
- Displaying castom text via the web interface
- Automatic or manual brightness adjustment of the matrix
- Possibility to set audible alarms (alarm clock)
- Night mode - matrix blanking at designated times
- Getting the time from NTP servers (RTC module is not required) and configuration of time zones
- Displaying the current temperature and publishing using mqtt
- Ability to display the weather forecast from openweathermap.org
- Remotely updating from a bin file (ArduinoOTA)
